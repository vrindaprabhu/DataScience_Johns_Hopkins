# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

Repo for the submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of data to produce a tidy data-set that can be used for subsequent analysis.

## Steps to reproduce this project

* The majority of the code i.e. the actual working code is written in form of R markdown file run_analysis.Rmd.
* To run the run_analysis.Rmd file,in the run_analysis.R script just change the working directory to required one and source the same (i.e change the setwd parameter).

## Output

* Tidy dataset file UCI_HAR_data_Avg.txt (tab-delimited text)
* A _run_analysis.html_ file explaining all procedures.

### Additional Information

* Most importantly the scripts assumes that the data is already present in the local directory for testing.
* Information on the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data can be found in CodeBook.md
* Inertial Signals data is not used
* Comments are welcome.
